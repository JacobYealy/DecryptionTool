# DecryptionTool
This python project takes an input string that is encrypted based on a key. The string is run against four of the most common encryption types: Caesar cipher, Vigenere, Rail Fence, and Transposition. The program also finds the key used to encrypt the string, with the program printing the encryption type, key used, and decrypted string.

*** Work in progress. Error/exception handling not implemented yet and only works for certain input as of now. ***
